# David Beazley's Blog

Hi, I'm [Dave](https://dabeaz.com).  This is my blog about various programming related topics.   You may know me from the Python world as the author of the [Python Cookbook](https://dabeaz.com/cookbook.html), [Python Essential Reference](https://dabeaz.com/per.html), and newly released [Python Distilled](https://dabeaz.com/python-distilled/index.html).  You can learn a lot about Python from my tutorials, talks, and courses below:

* [Tutorials](https://dabeaz.com/tutorials.html)
* [Talks](https://dabeaz.com/talks.html)
* [Practical Python Course](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python)

After a multi-year hiatus from blogging, this is a bit of an experiment in hosting a blog solely in the form of a GitHub repo.
