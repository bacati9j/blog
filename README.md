# Blog

This is [Dave Beazley's](https://dabeaz.com) blog.

After a multi-year hiatus from blogging, this is a bit of an experiment in hosting a blog solely in the form of a GitHub repo. If you see a typo or want to make a comment on something, submit a pull request.  You might even be able to do it from GitHub itself (press '.' to bring up an editor while viewing the repository).   You can view a nicely rendered version of the blog at [https://dabeaz.github.io/blog](https://dabeaz.github.io/blog).
