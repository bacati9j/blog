# Restarting A Blog

So, I've recently been thinking about a return to a bit of blogging.   I've blogged before--with a smattering of [articles](https://dabeaz.com/blog.html) on Blogger and elsewhere.   However, that "effort" was abandoned sometime in 2015.  Life gets busy sometimes.

## What am I hoping to accomplish here?

That's a good question.  Perhaps I'm just trying to organize my thoughts around some new topics related to programming and math.   Also, now that my [book](https://dabeaz.com/python-distilled/) is done, maybe it's a good time to do a bit more free-form writing and pondering. 

## What blogging platform?

I've been thinking long and hard about this question.  Maybe the best answer is to underthink the problem.  The main audience for any kind of "blog" that I'd create is coders. Hmmm. Coders. You know what? You're looking at the platform right now.  The blogging platform is Github.  Specifically this repo. 

There are a number of interesting things about using Github.  First, it's very much non-spammy--you won't find ads, paywalls, or anything of that sort here. Spot a typo?  Make a pull request or submit an issue.   Want to make a comment?  Make a pull request and add your remark to the discussion below.  That's it. 

## Discussion

- I like this idea so much that I couldn't resist trying out the 'pull request comment' workflow. It makes it feel almost like a collaborative blog project because you're editing the blog post itself. You could even have meta discussions on the pull request itself.
